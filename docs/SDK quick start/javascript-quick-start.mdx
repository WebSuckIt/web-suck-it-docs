# Javascript Quick Start

## Integrate the WebSuckIt SDK to your JavaScript application

### Install via NPM

```bash
npm install @websuckit/js
```

or

### Include via CDN

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@websuckit/js/dist/websuckit.umd.js"></script>
```

## Initialization

### Import the SDK

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<Tabs>
 <TabItem value="apple" label="ES6" default>
  <pre>
   <code>import Websuckit from '@websuckit/js';</code>
  </pre>
 </TabItem>
 <TabItem value="orange" label="CommonJS">
  <pre>
   <code>const Websuckit = require('@websuckit/js');</code>
  </pre>
 </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Initialize the SDK

```js
const ws = new Websuckit({
 userId: USER_ID,
 accessKey: ACCESS_KEY,
 publicKey: PUBLIC_KEY
});
```

You can obtain your `USER_ID`, `ACCESS_KEY`, and `PUBLIC_KEY` from the [WebSuckIt dashboard](https://websuckit.com/api-keys). For guidance on how to do this, please refer to the [**quick start guide**](https://websuckit.com/docs/quick-start).

## Channel

### Accessing a channel's websocket URL

To obtain a channel's websocket URL, use the `getConnectionUrl` method. This method takes an object with the following parameters:
- `channelName`: The name of the channel you want to connect to.
- `channelPassKey`: The passkey of the channel you want to connect to.

```js
const connectionUrl = ws.getConnectionUrl({
 channelName: CHANNEL_NAME,
 channelPassKey: CHANNEL_PASSKEY
});
```

### Create a channel

To create a channel, you can use the `createChannel` method, it returns a [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) that resolves to a channel object. This method takes an object with the `channel` property, specifying the name of the channel you want to create. The channel name should be in the format of a slug, for example, 'test-channel'.

> Note: please use only alphanumeric characters and hyphens (-) in channel names.

```js
const channelResponse = ws.createChannel({
 channel: "channel-name"
});
```

### Get a channel

To retrieve an existing channel, you can utilize the `getChannel` method. This method takes an object with the `channel` property, which specifies the name of the channel you wish to retrieve. It returns a promise that resolves to a channel object.

```js
const channelResponse = ws.getChannel({
 channel: "channel-name"
});
```

### Get channels

You can retrieve a list of all your channels using the `getChannels` method. This method takes an object with the following parameters:
- `page`: The page number (0-indexed).
- `per_page`: The number of channels per page.
- `search_key` (optional): Filter by channel name.

```js
const channelsResponse = ws.getChannels({
 page: "1", // Page number (0-indexed)
 per_page: "10", // Number of channels per page
 search_key: "channel-name" // Filter by channel name
});
```

### Get or create channel

You can use the `getOrCreateChannel` method to get an existing channel or create a new one. This method takes an object with the `channel` property, specifying the name of the channel you want to get or create.

```js
const channelResponse = ws.getOrCreateChannel({
 channel: "channel-name"
});
```

### Update a channel

To update a channel, you can use the `updateChannel` method. This method takes an object with the following parameters:

- `channelId`: The unique identifier (UUID) of the channel you want to update.
- `channel`: The new name for the channel.
- `regenerate_pass_key` (optional): A boolean value that, if set to true, regenerates the channel passkey. If set to false, the passkey remains unchanged.

```js
const channelResponse = ws.updateChannel({
 channelId: "channel-id",
 channel: "new-channel-name",
 regenerate_pass_key: false // (optional) if true, the channel passkey will be regenerated
});
```

# System Metrics Monitor in Python

This Python program is designed to efficiently gather system metrics and provide them as JSON payloads to clients through Websuckit.
This can be incredibly helpful for monitoring and analyzing system performance, as well as identifying areas for improvement.

**[Github Repository](https://github.com/WebSuckIt/web-suck-it-py/edit/main/examples/sysmetrics_reporter)**

## Project Directory

The project directory contains the following files:

- `config.py`: Contains configuration settings for the program.
- `metrics.py`: Contains functions for gathering system metrics.
- `server.py`: Contains the System metric server implementation for gathering and sending json.
- `sockit.py`: Contains the Websocket and WebSuckit implementation.
- `client.py`: Contains the System metric client implementation for receiving and processing JSON payloads.

## Usage

- Clone github repository `git clone https://github.com/WebSuckIt/web-suck-it-py`
- Change directory into `example` folder
- Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### Setting up the environment variables

```bash
# Get PUBLIC_KEY, USER_ID, CHANNEL_NAME, ACCESS_KEY from dashboard https://websuckit.com/dashboard
export WEBSUCKIT_USER_ID=USER_ID
export WEB_SUCKIT_PUBLIC_KEY=PUBLIC_KEY
export WEBSUCKIT_CHANNEL_NAME=CHANNEL_NAME
export WEB_SUCKIT_USER_ACCESS_KEY=ACCESS_KEY
```

### Configuration

The following configuration settings are available in `config.py` : <br/>
`report_interval`: integer - The time interval for reporting <br/>
`verbose`: boolean - basic logging level <br/>
`websuckit_user_access_key`: string <br/>
`websuckit_user_id`: UUID <br/>
`websuckit_public_key`: string <br/>
`websuckit_channel_name`: string

### Server

To use this program, follow these steps:

1. Start the server by running `python server.py`.
2. The server will send JSON payloads containing system metrics over the WebSocket connection.
